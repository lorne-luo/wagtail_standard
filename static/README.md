ESLint
==========================================================
1. ESLint is an open source JavaScript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain style guidelines.
No rules are enabled by default. The "extends": "eslint:recommended" property in a configuration file enables rules that report common problems. 
For more information about the ESLInt rules please refer to https://eslint.org/docs/rules/

2. eslint-plugin-prettier is a plugin that asks ESLint to run Prettier

3. eslint-config-prettier turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier
    1. There a few rules that eslint-config-prettier disables that actually can be enabled in some cases. For more information please refer to https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#special-rules
